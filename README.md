# Houseplant Model

This model was for [Femmehacks](https://www.femmehacks.io/) at the Univeristy of Pennsylvania. I participated in Femmehacks while I was a high school senior. Our final project was a website where you could upload an image of your houseplant depending on whether our model thought the plant was healthy or not reccomend care instructions. We worked in a team of four. I was responsible for building this model and we used Flask to serve the model. Our team collectively worked on the frontend using HTML/CSS/JavaScript to make the project accessible for use with a smartphone camera. This repository contains the notebook to train the model and the Flask app server code. I trained pickled the model in Kaggle and then served the model through Replit. The frontend can be found [here](https://github.com/penelopelarkin/Houseplant-Model-Frontend/tree/main).
